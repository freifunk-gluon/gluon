-- The QCA9980 was discontinued by Qualcomm. It didn't receive any firmware-update for over 4 years.
-- See https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/tree/master/QCA99X0/hw2.0
-- 802.11s was never implemented for the chip's firmware. It will most likely be broken forever.
-- The QCA9984 on the other hand works fine for 11s meshes on both bands.
