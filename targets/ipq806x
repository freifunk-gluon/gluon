# The QCA9980 was discontinued by Qualcomm. It didn't receive any firmware-update for over 4 years.
# See https://github.com/kvalo/ath10k-firmware/tree/master/QCA99X0/hw2.0
# 802.11s was never implemented for the chip's firmware. It will most likely be broken forever.
# The QCA9984 on the other hand works fine for 11s meshes on both bands.

# The BROKEN flag for the target can be removed when switching to an OpenWrt base newer than 18.06,
# as in 18.06 the LEDs are not yet functional. This is already fixed in the current OpenWrt master.
