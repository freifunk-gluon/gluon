 # The values have been reduced by a factor of 2 (3db) for non TPC devices
 # (in other words: devices with TPC can use twice the tx power of this table).
-# Note that the docs do not require TPC for 5150--5250; the reduction to
-# 100mW thus is not strictly required -- however the conservative 100mW
-# limit is used here as the non-interference with radar and satellite
-# apps relies on the attenuation by the building walls only in the
-# absence of DFS; the neighbour countries have 100mW limit here as well.
