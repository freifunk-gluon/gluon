Usage: $0 <secret> <manifest>

sign.sh adds lines to a manifest to indicate the approval
of the integrity of the firmware as required for automated
updates. The first argument <secret> references a file harboring
the private key of a public-private key pair of a developer
that referenced by its public key in the site configuration.
The script may be performed multiple times to the same document
to indicate an approval by multiple developers.
