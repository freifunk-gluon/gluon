## Installation
You can support the gluon CI with your infrastructure:
1. You need to query @lemoer (freifunk@irrelefant.net) for credentials.
2. He will give you a `SLAVE_NAME` and a `SLAVE_SECRET` for your host.
3. Then go to your docker host and substitute the values for  `SLAVE_NAME` and a `SLAVE_SECRET` in the following statements:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/
cd gluon/contrib/ci/jenkins-community-slave/
docker build -t gluon-jenkins .
mkdir /var/cache/openwrt_dl_cache/
docker run --detach --restart always \
    -e "SLAVE_NAME=whoareyou" \
    -e "SLAVE_SECRET=changeme" \
    -v /var/cache/openwrt_dl_cache/:/dl_cache
```
4. Check whether the instance is running correctly:
   - Your node should appear [here](https://build.ffh.zone/label/gluon-docker/).
   - When clicking on it, Jenkins should state "Agent is connected." like here:

5. **Your docker container needs to be rebuilt, when the build dependencies of gluon change. As soon as build dependencies have changed, the build dependency api level has to be raised.** After you rebuilt your docker container, notifiy @lemoer, so he can bump the versioning number.

## Backoff
- If @lemoer is not reachable, please be patient at first if possible. Otherwise contact info@hannover.freifunk.net or join the channel `#freifunkh` on hackint.
