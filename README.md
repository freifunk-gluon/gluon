# Gluon

Gluon is a firmware framework to build preconfigured OpenWrt images for public mesh networks.

## Getting started

We have a huge amount of documentation over at https://gluon.readthedocs.io/.

If you're new to Gluon and ready to get your feet wet, have a look at the
[Getting Started Guide](https://gluon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/getting_started.html).

Gluon's developers frequent an IRC chatroom at [#gluon](ircs://irc.hackint.org/#gluon)
on [hackint](https://hackint.org/). There is also a [webchat](https://webirc.hackint.org/#irc://irc.hackint.org/#gluon)
that allows for uncomplicated access from within your browser. This channel is also available as a bridged Matrix Room at [#gluon:hackint.org](https://matrix.to/#/#gluon:hackint.org).

## Issues & Feature requests

Before opening an issue, make sure to check whether any existing issues
(open or closed) match. If you're suggesting a new feature, drop by on IRC or
our mailinglist to discuss it first.

We maintain a [Roadmap](https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/wiki/Roadmap) for
the future development of Gluon.

## Use a release!

Please refrain from using the `master` branch for anything else but development purposes!
Use the most recent release instead. You can list all releases by running `git tag`
and switch to one by running `git checkout v2023.1.1 && make update`.

If you're using the autoupdater, do not autoupdate nodes with anything but releases.
If you upgrade using random master commits the nodes *might break* eventually.
