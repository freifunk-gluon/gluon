## Use a release!

Please refrain from using the master branch for anything else but development purposes!
Use the most recent release instead. You can list all relaseses by running `git branch -a`
and switch to one by running `git checkout v2014.3;make update`.

If you're using the autoupdater, do not autoupdate nodes with anything but releases.
If you upgrade using random master commits the nodes *will break* eventually.
