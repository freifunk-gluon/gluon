## Issues & Feature requests

Before opening an issue, make sure to check whether any existing issues
(open or closed) match. If you're suggesting a new feature, drop by on IRC or
our mailinglist to discuss it first.

We maintain a [Roadmap](https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/wiki/Roadmap) for
the future development of Gluon.

## Use a release!

Please refrain from using the `master` branch for anything else but development purposes!
Use the most recent release instead. You can list all relaseses by running `git branch -a`
and switch to one by running `git checkout v2016.2 && make update`.

If you're using the autoupdater, do not autoupdate nodes with anything but releases.
If you upgrade using random master commits the nodes *will break* eventually.
