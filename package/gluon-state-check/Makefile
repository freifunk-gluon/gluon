define Package/gluon-state-check/description
  gluon-state-check executes checks in `/lib/gluon/state/check.d/` and provides
  a flag file for each check in `/var/gluon/state` depending on the return code
  of the check. A flag file is created (or "touched") if the corresponding check
  exits cleanly and gets removed otherwise. If the flags are "touched", they
  are only accessed, but not modified. In this way, the atime of a flag file
  reflects when the last check was performed and the mtime reflects when
  when the state was last changed.

  This package provides the following checks:
  - `has_default_gw6` - check whether the router has a default IPv6-route on br-client.

  The checks are executed once every minute (by micron.d).
