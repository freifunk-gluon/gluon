define Package/gluon-ebtables-limit-arp/description
	Gluon community wifi mesh firmware framework: Ebtables rules to
	rate-limit ARP packets.

	This package adds filters to limit the amount of ARP Requests
	devices are allowed to send into the mesh. The limits are 6 packets
	per minute per client device, by MAC address, and 1 per second per
	node in total.

	A burst of up to 50 ARP Requests is allowed until the rate-limiting
	takes effect (see --limit-burst in the ebtables manpage).

	Furthermore, ARP Requests with a target IP already present in the
	batman-adv DAT Cache are excluded from the rate-limiting,
	both regarding counting and filtering, as batman-adv will respond
	locally with no burden for the mesh. Therefore, this limiter
	should not affect popular target IPs, like gateways.

	However it should mitigate the problem of curious people or
	smart devices scanning the whole IP range. Which could create
	a significant amount of overhead for all participants so far.
