Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix refcounting issue in batman-adv leading to hangs on interface restarts
  (`#1258 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1258>`_)

  This fix applied to both batman-adv compat 14 (legacy) and 15.

* Various batman-adv bugfixes have been backported
  (`f5b3c0c3bc7e <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/f5b3c0c3bc7e795b4b544cbaa49e9c6ca7581ce9>`_ and
  `5947ba300e50 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/5947ba300e50726a8af38fb115b834172780ab26>`_,
  fixing
  `#1321 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1321>`_,
  `#1380 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1380>`_,
  `#1382 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1382>`_,
  `#1419 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1419>`_
  and a number of other minor issues)

  The listed bugs could lead to high rates of batman-adv management traffic
  (causing considerable load), trigger warnings about packet checksum failures
  in certain non-standard interface configurations, and possibly other issues.


Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Linux kernel has been updated to v4.4.129 (LEDE/`81573ea25924 <https://git.openwrt.org/?p=openwrt/openwrt.git;a=commit;h=81573ea259247f1c6c1a7a490de174d0a6c48a64>`_)

* The description of the "contact information" field in the configuration wizard
  has been extended with regard to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
  (`fd355cf0ef7b <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/fd355cf0ef7ba0d1c9137bfb8fd76e87ad5d1aba>`_)

  The *mandatory* site option for the contact information field has been removed.


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.

* Frequent reboots due to out-of-memory on weak hardware in larger meshes
  (`#1243 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1243>`_)
