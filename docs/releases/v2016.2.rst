New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Many UBNT Airmax XM model names are detected correctly now (e.g., the Loco
  is no longer displayed as Bullet) (`#632 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/632>`_)

  Also, various new image aliases have been added for these devices.

* batman-adv: mesh_no_rebroadcast is now enabled for Mesh-on-WAN/LAN (`#652 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/652>`_)

* The new UCI option ``gluon-core.@wireless[0].preserve_channels`` can be used to
  prevent a changed WLAN channel from being reset on firmware upgrades (`#640 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/640>`_)

* PoE passthrough can now be configured from site.conf and the Advanced Settings
  on TP-Link CPE 210/510 and Ubiquiti NanoStations (`#328 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/328>`_)

* The config mode *altitude* field can now be hidden using the ``config_mode.geo_location.show_altitude``
  site.conf setting (`#693 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/693>`_)

* The contact information field in the config mode can be made obligatory using
  the ``config_mode.owner.obligatory`` site.conf option

* The *node name* setting in the config mode is no longer restricted to valid DNS
  hostnames, but allows any UTF-8 string (`#414 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/414>`_)

* Besides the hostname, public key, site config and primary MAC address, the contact
  information can now be accessed from config mode site texts

* The functions ``escape`` and ``urlescape`` for HTML and URL escaping are now available from config mode
  site texts. They should always be used when including user-provided information like
  hostnames and contact information in HTML code or URLs.

* Dropbear has been updated to a newer version, enabling new SSH crypto methods and removing
  some old ones like DSA. This reduces the time needed for the first boot and makes
  SSH logins faster (`#223 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/223>`_)

* WLAN basic and supported rate sets have been made configurable, to allow disabling
  802.11b rates (`#810 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/810>`_)

* ath10k-based devices are now supported officially; it's possible to choose between
  IBSS- and 11s-capable firmwares in site.mk (`#864 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/864>`_)

* The ``prefix4`` and ``next_node.ip4`` site.conf options are optional now.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* The stability of the ath9k WLAN driver has been improved significantly
  (`#605 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/605>`_)

  mac80211, hostapd and other related drivers and services have been backported from LEDE ``42f559e``.

* Extremely slow downloads could lead to multiple instances of the autoupdater
  running concurrently (`#582 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/582>`_)

  A lockfile is used to prevent this and timeouts have been added to download processes.

* Usage of static DNS servers on the WAN port has been fixed
  (`#886 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/886>`_)

  This is a regression introduced in Gluon v2016.1.6.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The "Expert Mode" has been renamed to "Advanced Settings"

Site changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

site.mk
^^^^^^^

If you want to support ath10k-based devices, you should set GLUON_ATH10K_MESH
and GLUON_REGION as described in :ref:`getting-started-make-variables`.

i18n
^^^^

As the hostname field may now contain an arbitrary UTF-8 string, escaping must
be added.

Change

::

  <%=hostname%>

to

::

  <%=escape(hostname)%>

Inside of URLs, ``urlescape`` must be used instead of ``escape``.

Internals
~~~~~~~~~

* Mesh interfaces are now configured in a protocol-independent way in UCI (`#870 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/870>`_)

  The MAC address assignment of all mesh and WLAN interfaces has been modified to prepare for support of
  Ralink/Mediatek-based WLAN chips.

* Preparations for supporting the new batman-adv multicast optimizations have been made
  (`#674 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/674>`_, `#675 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/675>`_,
  `#679 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/pull/679>`_)

* All Lua code is minified now to save some space

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promicious mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.
