Gluon 2015.1 (in development)
=============================

Added (and removed) hardware support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


New features

Bugfixes

Site changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``site.conf``

  - ``hostname_prefix`` is now optional, and is concatenated directly with the
    generated node ID, in particular no hyphen is inserted anymore. If you want
    to keep the old behaviour, you have to append the hyphen to the
    ``hostname_prefix`` field of your ``site.conf``.

  - ``mesh_vpn_fastd``: The default peer group name ``backbone`` isn't hardcoded anymore, any
    group name can be used. Instead, the ``fastd_mesh_vpn`` table must now contain an element ``groups``,
    for example::

      fastd_mesh_vpn = {
          methods = {'salsa2012+umac'},
          mtu = 1426,
          groups = {
              backbone = {
                  limit = 2,
                  peers = {
                      -- ...
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  - ``roles``: The display strings for the node roles aren't configured in the ``site.conf`` anymore, but
    in the site i18n files. The ``site.conf`` section becomes::

      roles = {
          default = 'foo',
          list = {
              'foo',
              'bar',
          }
      }

    The display string use i18n message IDs like ``gluon-luci-node-role:role:foo`` and ``gluon-luci-node-role:role:bar``.


* ``site.mk``

  - ``gluon-mesh-batman-adv-15`` is now the recommended batman-adv version for new Gluon deployments.

  - The packages ``gluon-setup-mode`` and ``gluon-config-mode-core`` must now be
    added to ``GLUON_SITE_PACKAGES`` explicitly (to allow replacing them with
    community-specific implementations).
