Site changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``site.conf``

  - ``hostname_prefix`` is now optional, and is concatenated directly with the
    generated node ID, in particular no hyphen is inserted anymore. If you want
    to keep the old behaviour, you have to append the hyphen to the
    ``hostname_prefix`` field of your ``site.conf``.
