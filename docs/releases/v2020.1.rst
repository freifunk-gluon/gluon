Major changes
-------------

OpenWrt 19.07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gluon v2020.1 is the first release to use OpenWrt 19.07. All targets
therefore use Linux 4.14.166.

batman-adv compat v14 removal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for the long deprecated compat 14 version of batman-adv has been
dropped. Communities still using this version should migrate to batman-adv
using the scheduled domain switch.

IBSS wireless mesh removal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for the IBSS wireless protocol has been dropped. Communities
still using IBSS are suggested to migrate to 802.11s using the scheduled
domain switch.

Performance enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We install zram-swap by default on ``ar71xx`` devices with 8MB of flash
and 32MB of RAM.

Renamed targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``ipq40xx`` target was renamed to ``ipq40xx-generic``.
- The ``ipq806x`` target was renamed to ``ipq806x-generic``.

Status Page
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Gateway nexthop information has been added to the statuspage when batman-adv
  is used. This includes its MAC address and prettyname as well as the interface
  name towards the selected gateway.
- The site name has been added to the statuspage. If the node is in a multidomain
  setup it will also show the domain name.

DECT button to enter config mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many AVM devices don't feature a separate RESET/WPS button, therefore
starting this release we support entering the config mode via DECT buttons.

X86 partition size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The x86 partition size has been reduced to fit on disks with a capacity of 128 MB.

Bugfixes
--------

Autoupdater aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have added several new aliases for autoupdater compatibility on
the following devices:

- Ubiquiti UniFi AC LR
- Raspberry Pi

Site changes
------------

site.mk
~~~~~~~

-  The ``GLUON_WLAN_MESH`` variable can be dropped, as 802.11s is
   the only supported wireless transport from now on.

Internals
---------

Linting Targets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for linter make targets was added.

- ``make lint``
- ``make lint-sh`` to only check shell scripts
- ``make lint-lua`` to only check lua scripts

These require the shellcheck and luacheck tools. The docker image has
been updated accordingly.

Continuous integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have implemented continuous integration testing using Jenkins and thereby
ensure that all lua and shell scripts are linted, that the documentation
still builds and warnings are highlighted, and that Gluon still
compiles, by testing a build on the ``x86_64`` target. We expect this to
significantly improve the feedback cycle and quality of contributions.
