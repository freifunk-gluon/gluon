Gluon 2016.1.2
==============

Added hardware support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *x86-generic* images now contain the ATIIXP PATA driver, adding support for
FUTRO Thin Clients.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

A nondeterministic boot hang (`#669 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/669>`_) has been fixed.
The TL-WR841N v5 seems to be affected in particular, but the kernel bug is not hardware-specific per se.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Expert Mode is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promicious mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.
