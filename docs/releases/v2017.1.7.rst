Gluon 2017.1.7
==============

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix boot failure on many Ubiquiti devices
  (`#1370 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1370>`_)

  A kernel update in Gluon 2017.1.6 led to boot failures on Ubiquiti Airmax M2/M5
  (NanoStation, Bullet, etc.) if the device had been running AirOS 5.6 before
  installing Gluon/OpenWrt. The XW hardware revision is unaffected.

  While the root cause is a bug in Ubiquiti's bootloader, the issue is mitigated in
  Gluon 2017.1.7.


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promicious mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.

* Frequent reboots due to out-of-memory on weak hardware in larger meshes
  (`#1243 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1243>`_)
