Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix build with empty ``site/modules``
  (`#1262 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1262>`_)

* Fix Ethernet stalls at high throughput on certain devices
  (`#1101 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1101>`_)

* Update Tunneldigger to support connections with servers running newer kernel
  versions (`9ed6ff752eb7 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/9ed6ff752eb7972d90b138197641f12eeb4572fb>`_)

* Fix batman-adv Bridge Loop Avoidance (BLA) with *gluon-ebtables-filter-multicast*
  (`#1198 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1198>`_)


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.

* Sporadic segfaults of busybox (ash) when running shell scripts on ar71xx
  (`#1157 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1157>`_)

  The workaround added in Gluon v2017.1.1 has greatly reduced the frequency of
  segfaults, but it did not make them disappear completely.

* Frequent reboots due to out-of-memory on weak hardware in larger meshes
  (`#1243 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1243>`_)
