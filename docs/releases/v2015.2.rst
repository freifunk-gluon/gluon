* ``site.conf``

  - New WLAN configuration

    ``wifi24`` and ``wifi5`` need to be updated to a new more flexible format.
    A configuration using the old format

    ::

      {
        channel = 1,
        ssid = 'entenhausen.freifunk.net',
        mesh_ssid = 'xe:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx',
        mesh_bssid = 'xe:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx',
        mesh_mcast_rate = 12000,
      }

    would look like this in the new format::

      {
        channel = 1,
        ap = {
          ssid = 'entenhausen.freifunk.net',
        },
        ibss = {
          ssid = 'xe:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx',
          bssid = 'xe:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx',
          mcast_rate = 12000,
        },
      }

    The ``htmode`` option has been dropped, the channel width is now always set to 20MHz
    (see https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/487 for a discussion of this change).

    In addition to the old IBSS (Adhoc) based meshing, 802.11s-based meshing can be configured
    using the ``mesh`` section. Example::

      {
        channel = 1,
        ap = {
          ssid = 'entenhausen.freifunk.net',
        },
        mesh = {
          id = 'mesh.entenhausen.freifunk.net', -- can by any string, human-readable or random
          mcast_rate = 12000,
        },
      }

    While using ``ibss`` and ``mesh`` at the same time is possible, is causes high load in
    very active meshes, so it is advisable to avoid such configurations.

  - Bandwidth limitation defaults

    The old section ``simple_tc.mesh_vpn`` has been moved to ``fastd_mesh_vpn.bandwidth_limit`` and the ``ifname``
    field isn't used anymore. What looked like this
    before

    ::

      simple_tc = {
        mesh_vpn = {
          ifname = 'mesh-vpn',
          enabled = false,
          limit_ingress = 3000,
          limit_egress = 200,
        }
      }

    needs to be changed to

    ::

      fastd_mesh_vpn = {
        -- ...

        bandwidth_limit = {
          enabled = false,
          ingress = 3000,
          egress = 200,
        },
      }

  - opkg repository configuration

    The opkg configuration has been changed to be more flexible and allow specifying custom repositories.
    Example::

      opkg = {
        openwrt = 'http://opkg.services.ffeh/openwrt/%n/%v/%S/packages',
        extra = {
          modules = 'http://opkg.services.ffeh/modules/gluon-%GS-%GR/%S',
        },
      }

    The keys of the ``extra`` table (like ``modules`` in this example) can be chosen arbitrarily.

    Instead of explicitly specifying the whole URL, using patterns is recommended. The following
    patterns are understood:

    - ``%n`` is replaced by the OpenWrt version codename (e.g. "chaos_calmer")
    - ``%v`` is replaced by the OpenWrt version number (e.g. "15.05")
    - ``%S`` is replaced by the target architecture (e.g. "ar71xx/generic")
    - ``%GS`` is replaced by the Gluon site code (as specified in ``site.conf``)
    - ``%GV`` is replaced by the Gluon version
    - ``%GR`` is replaced by the Gluon release (as specified in ``site.mk``)


* ``i18n/``

  - The translations of ``gluon-config-mode:pubkey`` now have to show the fastd
    public key itself if desired, making the formatting of the key and whether it is shown at
    all configurable. To retain the old format, add ``<p>`` to the beginning of
    your translations and append::

    "</p>"
    "<div class=\"the-key\">"
    " # <%= hostname %>"
    " <br/>"
    "<%= pubkey %>"
    "</div>"
