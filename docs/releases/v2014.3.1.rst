Gluon 2014.3.1
==============

This is a bugfix release.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* gluon-announced zombie process bug

  gluon-announced was creating zombie processes when answering requests, causing issues
  with the new status page which is currently in development.

* fastd peers removed from ``site.conf`` weren't removed correctly from the fastd configuration
  on firmware upgrades
* Expert Mode: setting a password will not remove SSH keys anymore
* alfred has been updated to 2014.3.0

  We hope this solves the alfred stability issues noted by several people.

* ``gluon-ebtables-filter-ra-dhcp`` and ``gluon-ebtables-filter-multicast`` have been fixed
  to allow DHCPv6 to work

* Another ath9k patch has been added, which might further improve WLAN stability and performance

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Support for static WAN setups instead of (DHCP/Router Advertisement) has been added;
  configuration is possible on the port config page of the Expert Mode.

Site changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``site.conf``

  - The new boolean option ``fastd_mesh_vpn.enabled`` allows
    enabling the mesh VPN by default. This value is optional;
    if it isn't specified, the mesh VPN will be disabled.
