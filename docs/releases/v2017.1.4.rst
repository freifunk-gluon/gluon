Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* LEDE has been updated to the latest stable commit, including various fixes for
  the kernel (including security updates), and making opkg work again. This also
  includes fixes for the KRACK issue (which is irrelevant for most Gluon
  deployments, as Gluon nodes are rarely used as WLAN clients)
  (`b62af904bbfd <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/b62af904bbfd6360ed728fc9ae69af3d8e8db1d7>`_,
  `ba56b41ddaf6 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/ba56b41ddaf6033e3cdef18d30da6b34cd438e8c>`_,
  `ad0824136e5b <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/ad0824136e5b47482e11483c50e7bc88ba2c506e>`_,
  `017fbe88bb8a <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/017fbe88bb8a89623464b02e09178696c1d077a6>`_)

* Fix DNS resolution for mesh VPN (fastd / tunneldigger) on ARM-based targets
  (`#1245 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1245>`_)

* Fix a build issue in *kmod-jool*
  (`06842728233a <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/06842728233a39784c437767eb9df4167ab07a87>`_)

* Fix enabling/disabling PoE Passthrough in *site.conf* or in the
  advanced settings
  (`7268e49a301f <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/7268e49a301fcd643a49b329bd6097a0f85bdaBb>`_,
  `7c2636d28264 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/7c2636d28264df20b448b0160b69f5059c40b84a>`_)


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.

* Sporadic segfaults of busybox (ash) when running shell scripts on ar71xx
  (`#1157 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1157>`_)

  The workaround added in Gluon v2017.1.1 has greatly reduced the frequency of
  segfaults, but it did not make them disappear completely.
