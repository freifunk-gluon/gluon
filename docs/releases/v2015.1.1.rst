Gluon 2015.1.1
==============

Added hardware support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ar71xx-generic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* TP-Link

  - TL-WA830RE (v1)

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The `x86-generic` and `x86-kvm_guest` images now support two ethernet interfaces by default. If two interfaces exist during
the first boot, `eth0` will be used as LAN and `eth1` as WAN.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* Fix German "Expert Mode" label (was "Export Mode")
* Fix download of OpenSSL during build (because of broken OpenSSL download servers...)
* Fix ABI break causing kernel panics when trying to use network-related modules from the official OpenWrt repository (like `kmod-pppoe`)
* Fix race conditions breaking parallel build occasionally
* A broken network configuration would be generated when an older Gluon version was updated to 2015.1 with
  ``mesh_on_lan`` enabled in `site.conf`
* Minor announced/alfred JSON format fixes (don't output empty lists where empty objects would be expected)
