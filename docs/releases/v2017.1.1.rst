Gluon 2017.1.1
==============

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

* The autoupdater manifest has been extended to allow automatic upgrades from
  old *x86-kvm* and *x86-xen_domu* systems to the new *x86-generic* image
  (`869ceb4 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/869ceb425cd5f9db3eafddcc52377fd94c6ba0dd>`_)

* Make flash writable again on Ubiquiti PicoStations with certain bootloader
  versions (and possibly other devices)
  (`9a787c9 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/9a787c9878069158151c843b8fd9aa338815d61e>`_)

  Units affected by this issue running Gluon v2017.1 can't leave config mode and
  no regular sysupgrades are possible. TFTP recovery is necessary to make them
  work again.

* Add workaround to prevent sporadic segfaults of busybox (ash) when running shell scripts on ar71xx
  (`#1157 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/1157>`_)

* Disable batman-adv multicast optimizations to work around issue causing large
  amounts of management traffic
  (`819758f <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/commit/819758f4250af8820851945ba1a6c17748b0ab4b>`_)

  Multicast optimizations will be enabled again when a proper fix is available.

Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Default TX power on many Ubiquiti devices is too high, correct offsets are unknown (`#94 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/94>`_)

  Reducing the TX power in the Advanced Settings is recommended.

* The MAC address of the WAN interface is modified even when Mesh-on-WAN is disabled (`#496 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/496>`_)

  This may lead to issues in environments where a fixed MAC address is expected (like VMware when promiscuous mode is disallowed).

* Inconsistent respondd API (`#522 <https://github.com/freifunk-gluon/gluon/issues/522>`_)

  The current API is inconsistent and will be replaced eventually. The old API will still be supported for a while.
