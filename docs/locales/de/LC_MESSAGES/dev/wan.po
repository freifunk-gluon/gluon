"To separate the DNS servers in the mesh from the ones on the WAN, the "
"``gluon-wan-dnsmasq`` package provides a secondary DNS daemon which runs "
"on ``127.0.0.1:54``. It will automatically use all DNS servers explicitly"
" configured in ``/etc/config/gluon-wan-dnsmasq`` or received via DNS/RA "
"on the WAN port. It is important that no DNS servers for the WAN "
"interface are configured in ``/etc/config/network`` and that ``peerdns`` "
"is set to 0 so the WAN DNS servers aren't leaked to the primary DNS "
"daemon."
