"After each sysupgrade (including the initial installation), Gluon will "
"execute all scripts under ``/lib/gluon/upgrade``. These scripts' "
"filenames usually begin with a 3-digit number specifying the order of "
"execution. Note that the script files need to be executable."

"To get an overview of the ordering of all scripts of all packages, the "
"helper script ``contrib/lsupgrade.sh`` in the Gluon repository can be "
"used, which will print all upgrade scripts' filenames and directories. If"
" executed on a TTY, the filename will be highlighted in green, the "
"repository in blue and the package in red."

"Whenever possible, scripts shouldn't check if they are running for the "
"first time, but just edit configuration files to achieve a valid "
"configuration (without overwriting configuration changes made by the user"
" where desirable). This allows using the same code to create the initial "
"configuration and upgrade configurations on upgrades."
