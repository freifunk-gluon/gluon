"Gluon allows to configure 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios independently. The "
"configuration may include any or all of the three networks \"client\" (AP"
" mode), \"mesh\" (802.11s mode) and \"ibss\" (adhoc mode), which can be "
"used simultaneously (using \"mesh\" and \"ibss\" at same time should be "
"avoided though as weaker hardware usually can't handle the additional "
"load). See :doc:`../user/site` for details on the configuration."

"For each of these networks, the site configuration may define a "
"`disabled` flag (by default, all configured networks are enabled). This "
"flag is merely a default setting, on upgrades the existing setting is "
"always retained (as this setting may have been changed by the user). This"
" means that it is not possible to enable or disable an existing network "
"configurations during upgrades."

"For the \"mesh\" and \"ibss\" networks, the default setting only has an "
"effect if none of the two has existed before. If a new configuration has "
"been added for \"mesh\" or \"ibss\", while the other of the two has "
"already existed before, the enabled/disabled state of the existing "
"configuration will also be set for the new configuration."
