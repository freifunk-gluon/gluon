"In addition to meshing over WLAN and VPN, it is also possible to "
"configure wired meshing over the LAN or WAN ports. This allows nodes to "
"be connected directly or over wireless bridges."

"Mesh-on-WAN can be enabled in addition to the mesh VPN, so multiple nodes"
" in the same local network that is used as VPN uplink can also mesh "
"directly. Enabling Mesh-on-WAN should be avoided if the local network is "
"also bridged with a WLAN access point, as meshing over batman-adv causes "
"large amounts of multicast traffic, which will take up a lot of airtime."

"Enabling Mesh-on-LAN replaces the normal \"client network\" function of "
"the LAN ports, as client network ports may never be connected (so care "
"must be taken to always enable Mesh-on-LAN before connecting two nodes' "
"LAN ports)."

"Since version 2018.1, Gluon supports encapsulating wired mesh traffic in "
"`VXLAN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN>`_, a new "
"standard with use cases similar to VLANs, but a much greater ID space of "
"24bit; in addition, VXLAN packets pass through VLAN-aware switches "
"without any special configuration."

"By using a different VXLAN ID for each site and mesh domain, accidental "
"wired mesh connections between nodes of different domains will be "
"prevented. This has special importance when nodes migrate between domains"
" automatically, as currently possible through different site-specific "
"packages."

"While batman-adv traffic does not interact with non-mesh traffic in the "
"same wired network in any way (so Gluon nodes can mesh over existing "
"wired networks), this is not the case for layer 3 mesh protocols like "
"Babel. Encapsulating the traffic allows to distinguish mesh traffic from "
"unrelated packets."

"domain using the site configuration setting *mesh.vxlan*. VXLAN is "
"enabled by default in multidomain setups; in single-domain site "
"configurations, the *mesh.vxlan* setting is mandatory. We recommend to "
"enable VXLAN encapsulation in all new sites and domains."
