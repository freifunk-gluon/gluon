"A manifest file for the updater can be generated with `make manifest`. A "
"signing script (using ``ecdsautils``) can be found in the `contrib` "

"``GLUON_PRIORITY`` defines the maximum number of days that may pass "
"between releasing an update and installation of the images. The update "
"probability will start at 0 after the release time declared in the "
"manifest file by the variable DATE and then slowly rise up to 1 when "
"``GLUON_PRIORITY`` days have passed. The autoupdater checks for updates "
"hourly (at a random minute of the hour), but usually only updates during "
"its run between 4am and 5am, except when the whole ``GLUON_PRIORITY`` "
"days and another 24 hours have passed."
