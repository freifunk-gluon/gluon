"The limits per client device, identified by its MAC address, are 6 "
"packets per minute and 1 per second per node in total. A burst of up to "
"50 ARP requests is allowed until the rate-limiting takes effect (see "
"``--limit-burst`` in ``ebtables(8)``)."

"Furthermore, ARP requests for a target IP already present in the batman-"
"adv DAT cache are excluded from rate-limiting, in regard to both counting"
" and filtering, as batman-adv will be able to respond locally without a "
"burden for the mesh. Therefore, this limiter should not affect popular "
"target IP addresses, like those of gateways or nameservers."

"However it mitigates the impact on the mesh when a larger range of its "
"IPv4 subnet is being scanned, which would otherwise result in a "
"significant amount of ARP chatter, even for unused IP addresses."
