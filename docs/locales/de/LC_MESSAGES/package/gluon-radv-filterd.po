"The router selection mechanism is independent from the batman-adv gateway"
" mode. In contrast, the device originating the router advertisement could"
" be any router or client connected to the mesh, as radv-filterd captures "
"all router advertisements originating  from it. All nodes announcing "
"router advertisement **with** a default lifetime greater than 0 are being"
" considered as candidates."

"Initially the router is the selected by choosing the candidate with the "
"strongest TQ. When another candidate can provide a better TQ metric it is"
" not picked up as the selected router until it will outperform the "
"currently selected router by X metric units. The hysteresis threshold is "
"configurable and prevents excessive flapping of the gateway."

"The package has functionality to select \"local\" routers, i.e. those "
"connected via cable or WLAN instead of via the mesh (technically: "
"appearing in the ``transtable_local``), a fake TQ of 512 so that they are"
" always preferred. However, if used together with the :doc:`gluon-"
"ebtables-filter-ra-dhcp` package, these router advertisements are "
"filtered anyway and reach neither the node nor any other client. You "
"currently have to disable the package or insert custom ebtables rules in "
"order to use local routers."
