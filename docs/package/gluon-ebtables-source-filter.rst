gluon-ebtables-source-filter
============================

The *gluon-ebtables-source-filter* package adds an additional layer-2 filter
ruleset to prevent unreasonable traffic entering the network via the nodes.
Unreasonable means traffic entering the mesh via a node which source IP does
not belong to the configured IP space.

One may first check if there is a certain proportion of unreasonable traffic,
before adding this package to the firmware image. Additional one should not
use this package if some kind of gateway or upstream network is provided by
a device connected to the client port.
