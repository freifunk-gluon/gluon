gluon-scheduled-domain-switch
=============================

This package allows to switch a routers domain at a given point
in time. This is needed for switching between incompatible transport
protocols (e.g. 802.11s and IBSS or VXLAN).

Nodes will switch when the defined *switch-time* has passed. In case the node was
powered off while this was supposed to happen, it might not be able to aquire the
correct time. In this case, the node will switch after it has not seen any gateway
for a given period of time.

site.conf
---------
All those settings have to be defined exclusively in the domain, not the site.

domain_switch : optional (needed for domains to switch)
    target_domain :
        - target domain to switch to
    switch_after_offline_mins :
        - amount of time without reachable gateway to switch unconditionally
    switch_time :
        - UNIX epoch after which domain will be switched
    connection_check_targets :
        - array of IPv6 addresses which are probed to determine if the node is
	  connected to the mesh

Example::

  domain_switch = {
    target_domain = 'new_domain',
    switch_after_offline_mins = 120,
    switch_time = 1546344000, -- 01.01.2019 - 12:00 UTC
    connection_check_targets = {
      '2001:4860:4860::8888',
      '2001:4860:4860::8844',
    },
  },
