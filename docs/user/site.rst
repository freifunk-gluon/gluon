Site
====

The ``site`` consists of the files ``site.conf`` and ``site.mk``.
In the first community based values are defined, which both are processed
during the build process and runtime.
The last is directly included in the make process of Gluon.

Configuration
-------------

The ``site.conf`` is a lua dictionary with the following defined keys.

hostname_prefix
    An optional string which would prefix the generated default hostname of a device.
    If you want to force the user to think about a unique name enter an invalid prefix
    with spaces like 'Enter a name for your node'

site_name
    The name of your community.

site_code
    The code of your community. It is good practice to use the TLD of
    your community here.

prefix4
    The IPv4 Subnet of your community mesh network in CIDR notation, e.g.
    ::

       prefix4 = '10.111.111.0/18'

prefix6
    The IPv6 subnet of your community mesh network, e.g.
    ::

       prefix6 = 'fdca::ffee:babe:1::/64'

timezone
    The timezone of your community live in, e.g.
    ::

      -- Europe/Berlin
      timezone = 'CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3'

ntp_server
    List of NTP servers available in your community or used by your community, e.g.:
    ::

       ntp_servers = {'1.ntp.services.ffeh','2.tnp.services.ffeh'}

opkg_repo : optional
    Overwrite the default ``opkg`` repository server, e.g.:
    ::

      opkg_repo = 'http://opkg.services.ffeh/attitude_adjustment/12.09/%S/packages'

    The `%S` is a variable, which is replaced with the platform of a device
    during the build process.

regdom
    The wireless regulatory domain responsible for your area, e.g.:
    ::

      regdom = 'DE'

wifi24
    WLAN configuration for 2.4 GHz devices.
    ``channel`` must be set to a valid wireless channel for your radio.
    ``htmode`` selects the desired htmode (e.g. HT20, HT40- or HT40+).

    There are currently three interface types available. You many choose to
    configure any subset of them:

    - ``ap`` creates a master interface where clients may connect
    - ``mesh`` creates an 802.11s mesh interface with forwarding disabled
    - ``ibss`` creates an ad-hoc interface

    Each interface may be disabled by setting ``disabled`` to ``true``.
    This will only affect new installations.
    Upgrades will not changed the disabled state.

    ``ap`` requires a single parameter, a string, named ``ssid`` which sets the 
    interface's ESSID.

    ``mesh`` requires a single parameter, a string, named ``id`` which sets the mesh id.

    ``ibss`` requires two parametersr: ``ssid`` (a string) and ``bssid`` (a MAC).
    An optional parameter ``vlan`` (integer) is supported.

    Both ``mesh`` and ``ibss`` accept an optional ``mcast_rate`` (kbit/s) parameter for 
    setting the default multicast datarate.
    ::

       wifi24 = {
         channel = 6,
         htmode = 'HT20',
         ap = {
           ssid = 'gothamcity.freifunk.net',
         },
         mesh = {
           id = 'gothamcity-mesh',
           mcast_rate = 12000,
         },
         ibss = {
           ssid = 'ff:ff:ff:ee:ba:be',
           bssid = 'ff:ff:ff:ee:ba:be',
           mcast_rate = 12000,
         },
       },

wifi5
    Same as `wifi24` but for the 5Ghz radio.

next_node : package
    Configuration of the local node feature of Gluon
    ::

      next_node = {
        ip4 = '10.23.42.1',
        ip6 = 'fdca:ffee:babe:1::1',
        mac = 'ca:ff:ee:ba:be:00'
      }


fastd_mesh_vpn
    Remote server setup for the fastd-based mesh VPN.

    The `enabled` option can be set to true to enable the VPN by default.

    If `configurable` is set to `false` or unset, the method list will be replaced on updates
    with the list from the site configuration. Setting `configurable` to `true` will allow the user to
    add the method ``null`` to the beginning of the method list or remove ``null`` from it,
    and make this change survive updates. The settings `configurable` is necessary for the
    package `gluon-luci-mesh-vpn-fastd`, which adds a UI for this configuration.

    In any case, the ``null`` method should always be the first method in the list
    if it is supported at all. You should only set `configurable` to `true` if the
    configured peers support both the ``null`` method and methods with encryption.
    ::

      fastd_mesh_vpn = {
        methods = {'salsa2012+umac'},
      	-- enabled = true,
      	-- configurable = true,
        mtu = 1280,
        groups = {
          backbone = {

            limit = 1,
            peers = {
              peer1 = {
                key = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
                -- you might add multiple entries.
                remotes = {
                  'ipv4 "gw0.gothamcity.freifunk.net" port 10000',
                  'ipv6 "gw0.gothamcity.freifunk.net" port 10000', 
                },
              },
              peer2 = {
                key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
                -- You can also omit the ipv4 to allow both connection via ipv4 and ipv6
                remotes = {
                  '"gw1.gothamcity.freifunk.net" port 10000',
                },
              },
            },
          }
          -- Optional: nested peer groups
          -- groups = {
          --   backbone_sub = {
          --     ...
          --   },
          --   ...
          -- },
        },
        -- Optional: additional peer groups, possibly with other limits
        -- backbone2 = {
        --   ...
        -- },
      }

mesh_on_wan : optional
    Enables the mesh on the WAN port (``true`` or ``false``).

mesh_on_lan : optional
    Enables the mesh on the LAN port (``true`` or ``false``).

autoupdater : package
    Configuration for the autoupdater feature of Gluon.
    ::

      autoupdater = {
        branch = 'stable',
        branches = {
          stable = {
            name = 'stable',
            
            -- List of mirrors to fetch images from. IPv6 required!
            mirrors = {
              'http://[fdca:ffee:babe:1::fec1]/firmware/stable/sysupgrade/',
              'http://services.gothamcity.freifunk.net/firmware/stable/sysupgrade/',
            },
            
            -- Number of good signatures required.
      	    -- Have multiple maintainers sign your build and only
      	    -- accept it when a sufficient number of them have
      	    -- signed it, for ex. 3 for stable and 1 for experimental
      	    good_signatures = 3,
      	    
      	    -- List of public keys of maintainers.
            pubkeys = {
              'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', -- someguy
              'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', -- someother
            }
          }
        }
      }

roles : optional
    Optional role definitions. Nodes will announce their role inside the mesh.
    This will allow in the backend to distinguish between normal, backbone and
    service nodes or even gateways (if they advertise that role). It is up to
    the community which roles to define. See the section below as an example.
    ``default`` takes the default role which is set initially. This value should be
    part of ``list``. If you want node owners to change the role via config mode add
    the package ``gluon-luci-node-role`` to ``site.mk``.

    The strings to display in the LuCI interface can be configured per language in the
    ``i18n/en.po``, ``i18n/de.po``, etc. files of the site repository using message IDs like
    ``gluon-luci-node-role:role:node`` and ``gluon-luci-node-role:role:backbone``.
    ::

      roles = {
        default = 'node',
        list = {
          'node',
          'test',
          'backbone',
          'service',
        },
      },

simple_tc : package
    Uplink Bandwidth limiting
    ::

      simple_tc = {
        mesh_vpn = {
          ifname = 'mesh-vpn',
          -- You may enable it by default here.
          enabled = false,
          -- Default upload limit (kbit/s).
          limit_egress = 500,
          -- Default download limit (kbit/s).
          limit_ingress = 4000,
        },
      },

setup_mode : package
    Allows skipping setup mode (config mode) at first boot when attribute
    ``skip`` is set to ``true``. This is optional and may be left out. If set to `true`,
    make sure that you enter a valid `hostname_prefix`.
    ::

      setup_mode = {
        skip = true,
      },

legacy : package
    Configuration for the legacy upgrade path.
    This is only required in communities upgrading from LÃ¼beck's LFF-0.3.x.
    ::

      legacy = {
             version_files = {'/etc/.freifunk_version_keep', '/etc/.eff_version_keep'},
             old_files = {'/etc/config/config_mode', '/etc/config/ffeh', '/etc/config/freifunk'},
             config_mode_configs = {'config_mode', 'ffeh', 'freifunk'},
             fastd_configs = {'ffeh_mesh_vpn', 'mesh_vpn'},
             mesh_ifname = 'freifunk',
             tc_configs = {'ffki', 'freifunk'},
             wifi_names = {'wifi_freifunk', 'wifi_freifunk5', 'wifi_mesh', 'wifi_mesh5'},
      }

Packages
--------

The ``site.mk`` is a Makefile which should define constants
involved in the build process of Gluon.

GLUON_SITE_PACKAGES
    Defines a list of packages which should be installed additionally
    to the ``gluon_core`` package.

GLUON_RELEASE
    The current release version Gluon should use.

GLUON_PRIORITY
    The default priority for the generated manifests (see the autoupdater documentation
    for more information).

GLUON_LANGS
    List of languages (as two-letter-codes) to be included in the web interface. Should always contain
    ``en``.

.. _site-config-mode-texts:

Config mode texts
-----------------

The community-defined texts in the config mode are configured in PO files in the ``i18n`` subdirectory
of the site configuration. The message IDs currently defined are:

gluon-config-mode:welcome
    Welcome text on the top of the config wizard page.

gluon-config-mode:pubkey
    Information about the public VPN key on the reboot page.

gluon-config-mode:reboot
    General information about the reboot page.

There is a POT file in the site example directory which can be used to create templates
for the language files. The command ``msginit -l en -i ../../docs/site-example/i18n/gluon-site.pot``
can be used from the ``i18n`` directory to create an initial PO file called ``en.po`` if the ``gettext``
utilities are installed.

.. note::

   An empty ``msgstr``, as is the default after running ``msginit``, leads to
   the ``msgid`` being printed as-is. It does *not* hide the whole text, as
   might be expected.

   Depending on the context, you might be able to use comments like
   ``<!-- empty -->`` as translations to effectively hide the text.
