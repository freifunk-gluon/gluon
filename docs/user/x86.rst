x86 support
===========

Gluon can run on normal x86 systems, for example virtual machines
and VPN boxes. By default, there is no WLAN support on x86 though.

Targets
^^^^^^^

The following targets for x86 images exist:

`x86-generic`
    Generic x86 support with many different ethernet drivers; should run on
    most x86 systems.

    There are three images:

    * `generic` (compressed "raw" image, can written to a disk directly or booted with qemu)
    * `virtualbox` (VDI image)
    * `vmware` (VMDK image)

    These images only differ in the image file format, the content is the same. Therefore there is
    only a single `x86-generic` sysupgrade image instead of three.

    Please note that the `x86-generic` image doesn't include VirtIO support, so another virtual NIC
    like `pcnet32` must be chosen when using VirtualBox.

`x86-kvm`
    The `x86-kvm` image uses VirtIO as its harddisk and network driver.

`x86-xen_domu`
    The `x86-xen_domu` target contains the necessary drivers for use in Xen.

`x86-64`
    64bit version of `x86-generic`. Also has VirtIO support, so there's no need for an
    `x86-64-kvm` target.
