x86 support
===========

Gluon can run on normal x86 systems, for example virtual machines
and VPN boxes. By default, there is no WLAN support on x86 though.

Targets
^^^^^^^

The following targets for x86 images exist:

`x86-64`
    Generic x86 64-bit support with many different ethernet drivers; should run on
    most x86 systems with 64-bit support.

    There are three images:

    * `generic` (compressed "raw" image, can be written to a disk directly or booted with qemu)
    * `virtualbox` (VDI image)
    * `vmware` (VMDK image)

    These images differ in the image file format, the content is the same. Therefore
    a single `x86-64` sysupgrade image is provided, only.

`x86-generic`
    32-bit version of `x86-64` for hardware not supporting 64-bit images.
    Also comes with `virtualbox` and `vmware` factory installs.

`x86-geode`
    x86 image for Geode CPUs.

`x86-legacy`
    x86 image for very old PC hardware like i586.
