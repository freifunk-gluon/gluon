.. _faq-dns:

Why does DNS not work on the nodes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gluon nodes will ignore the DNS server on the WAN port for everything except
the mesh VPN, which can lead to confusion.

All normal services on the nodes exclusively use the DNS server on the mesh
interface. This DNS server must be announced in router advertisements (using
*radvd* or a similar software) from one or more central servers in meshes based
on *batman-adv*. If your mesh does not have global IPv6 connectivity, you can setup
your *radvd* not to announce a default route by setting the *default lifetime* to 0;
in this case, the *radvd* is only used to announce the DNS server.
