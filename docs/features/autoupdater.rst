Autoupdater
===========

Infrastructure
--------------

We suggest to have following directory tree accessible via http:

::

    firmware/
            stable/
                    sysupgrade/
                    factory/
            snapshot/
                    sysupgrade/
                    factory/
            experimental/
                    sysupgrade/
                    factory/

The last level is generated by the Gluon build process. Do not forget
to rename the ``<branch>.manifest`` into ``manifest`` inside of the
sysupgrade directories.

The server should be available via IPv6.

Command Line
------------

::

   # Update with some probability 
   autoupdate

:: 

   # Force Update Check  
   autoupdater -f
