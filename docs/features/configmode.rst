Config Mode
===========

When in Config Mode a node will neither participate in the mesh nor connect
to the VPN using the WAN port. Instead, it'll offer a web interface on the
LAN port to aid configuration of the node.

Whether a node is in Config Mode can be determined by a characteristic
blinking sequence of the SYS LED:

Activating Config Mode
----------------------

Config Mode is automatically entered at the first boot. You can re-enter
Config Mode by pressing and holding the RESET/WPS/DECT button for about three
seconds. The device should reboot (all LEDs will turn off briefly) and
Config Mode will be available.


Port Configuration
------------------

In general, Config Mode will be offered on the LAN ports. However, there
are two practical exceptions:

* Devices with just one network port will run Config Mode on that port.
* Devices with PoE on the WAN port will run Config Mode on the WAN port instead.


Accessing Config Mode
---------------------

Config Mode can be accessed at http://192.168.1.1. The node will offer DHCP
to clients. Should this fail, you may assign an IP from 192.168.1.0/24 to
your computer manually.
