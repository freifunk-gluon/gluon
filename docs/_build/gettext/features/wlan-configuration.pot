msgid "Gluon allows to configure 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios independently. The configuration may include any or all of the three networks \"client\" (AP mode), \"mesh\" (802.11s mode) and \"ibss\" (adhoc mode), which can be used simultaneously (using \"mesh\" and \"ibss\" at same time should be avoided though as weaker hardware usually can't handle the additional load). See :doc:`../user/site` for details on the configuration."

msgid "For each of these networks, the site configuration may define a `disabled` flag (by default, all configured networks are enabled). This flag is merely a default setting, on upgrades the existing setting is always retained (as this setting may have been changed by the user). This means that it is not possible to enable or disable an existing network configurations during upgrades."

msgid "For the \"mesh\" and \"ibss\" networks, the default setting only has an effect if none of the two has existed before. If a new configuration has been added for \"mesh\" or \"ibss\", while the other of the two has already existed before, the enabled/disabled state of the existing configuration will also be set for the new configuration."
