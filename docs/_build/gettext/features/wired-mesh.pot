msgid "In addition to meshing over WLAN and VPN, it is also possible to configure wired meshing over the LAN or WAN ports. This allows nodes to be connected directly or over wireless bridges."

# 9d0106b6051d4f3d934c3d57eb96adb7
msgid "Mesh-on-WAN can be enabled in addition to the mesh VPN, so multiple nodes in the same local network that is used as VPN uplink can also mesh directly. Enabling Mesh-on-WAN should be avoided if the local network is also bridged with a WLAN access point, as meshing over batman-adv causes large amounts of multicast traffic, which will take up a lot of airtime."

msgid "Enabling Mesh-on-LAN replaces the normal \"client network\" function of the LAN ports, as client network ports may never be connected (so care must be taken to always enable Mesh-on-LAN before connecting two nodes' LAN ports)."

msgid "Since version 2018.1, Gluon supports encapsulating wired mesh traffic in `VXLAN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN>`_, a new standard with use cases similar to VLANs, but a much greater ID space of 24bit; in addition, VXLAN packets pass through VLAN-aware switches without any special configuration."

msgstr ""

#: ../../features/wired-mesh.rst:28
# fb4c185b98234d0b8ee7d9184d0a3de4
msgid "By using a different VXLAN ID for each site and mesh domain, accidental wired mesh connections between nodes of different domains will be prevented. This has special importance when nodes migrate between domains automatically, as currently possible through different site-specific packages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../features/wired-mesh.rst:32
# 604b8f384bf943a1bc5a4aa216685a2e
msgid "While batman-adv traffic does not interact with non-mesh traffic in the same wired network in any way (so Gluon nodes can mesh over existing wired networks), this is not the case for layer 3 mesh protocols like Babel. Encapsulating the traffic allows to distinguish mesh traffic from unrelated packets."
msgstr ""

# e2da919e4cbc4c708dcc14948c146277
msgid "As enabling VXLAN encapsulation will prevent wired mesh communication with old nodes that do not support VXLAN yet, VXLANs can be enabled per-domain using the site configuration setting *mesh.vxlan*. VXLAN is enabled by default in multidomain setups; in single-domain site configurations, the *mesh.vxlan* setting is mandatory. We recommend to enable VXLAN encapsulation in all new sites and domains."
