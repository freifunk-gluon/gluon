msgid "To get an overview of the ordering of all scripts of all packages, the helper script ``contrib/lsupgrade.sh`` in the Gluon repository can be used, which will print all upgrade scripts' filenames and directories. If executed on a TTY, the filename will be highlighted in green, the repository in blue and the package in red."

msgid "Whenever possible, scripts shouldn't check if they are running for the first time, but just edit configuration files to achieve a valid configuration (without overwriting configuration changes made by the user where desirable). This allows using the same code to create the initial configuration and upgrade configurations on upgrades."
