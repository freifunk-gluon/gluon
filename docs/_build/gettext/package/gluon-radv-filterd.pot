msgid "The router selection mechanism is independent from the batman-adv gateway mode. In contrast, the device originating the router advertisement could be any router or client connected to the mesh, as radv-filterd captures all router advertisements originating  from it. All nodes announcing router advertisement **with** a default lifetime greater than 0 are being considered as candidates."

msgid "In case a router is not a batman-adv originator itself, its TQ is defined by the originator it is connected to. This lookup uses the batman-adv global translation table."

msgid "Initially the router is the selected by choosing the candidate with the strongest TQ. When another candidate can provide a better TQ metric it is not picked up as the selected router until it will outperform the currently selected router by X metric units. The hysteresis threshold is configurable and prevents excessive flapping of the gateway."

msgid "The package has functionality to select \"local\" routers, i.e. those connected via cable or WLAN instead of via the mesh (technically: appearing in the ``transtable_local``), a fake TQ of 512 so that they are always preferred. However, if used together with the :doc:`gluon-ebtables-filter-ra-dhcp` package, these router advertisements are filtered anyway and reach neither the node nor any other client. You currently have to disable the package or insert custom ebtables rules in order to use local routers."
