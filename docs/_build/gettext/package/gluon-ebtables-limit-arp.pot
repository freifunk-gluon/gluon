msgid "The limits per client device, identified by its MAC address, are 6 packets per minute and 1 per second per node in total. A burst of up to 50 ARP requests is allowed until the rate-limiting takes effect (see ``--limit-burst`` in ``ebtables(8)``)."

msgid "Furthermore, ARP requests for a target IP already present in the batman-adv DAT cache are excluded from rate-limiting, in regard to both counting and filtering, as batman-adv will be able to respond locally without a burden for the mesh. Therefore, this limiter should not affect popular target IP addresses, like those of gateways or nameservers."

msgid "However it mitigates the impact on the mesh when a larger range of its IPv4 subnet is being scanned, which would otherwise result in a significant amount of ARP chatter, even for unused IP addresses."
