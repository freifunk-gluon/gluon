msgid "The removal of CORS breaks compatibility with the node switching feature of the old status page implementation: In the new status page, switching to another node will reload the whole status page from the target node, while the old implementation would only switch to another backend host. While this will facilitate future updates, as frontend and backend always come from the same node and no stable API needs to be maintained, it prevents switching from the old status page to nodes running the new version."

In addition, the gluon-web-model package was split out of the gluon-web core package, as model support is only required for config mode packages, but not for the new status page."

msgid "In earlier version of Gluon, all gluon-web (formerly LuCI) packages shared the same i18n namespace, so independent packages could override each others translations (with an arbitrary translation of the same string \"winning\"). This issue has been solved by giving each package its own translation namespace, which is defined by the *package* directive in a package's controller. It is still possible to access a different i18n namespace (e.g. gluon-web base or site translations), which is described in :doc:`../dev/web/i18n`."
