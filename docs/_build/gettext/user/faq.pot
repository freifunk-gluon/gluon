msgid "All normal services on the nodes exclusively use the DNS server on the mesh interface. This DNS server must be announced in router advertisements (using *radvd* or a similar software) from one or more central servers in meshes based on *batman-adv*. If your mesh does not have global IPv6 connectivity, you can setup your *radvd* not to announce a default route by setting the *default lifetime* to 0; in this case, the *radvd* is only used to announce the DNS server."

msgid "Calculating the maximum transport MTU is interesting, because it increases the throughput, by allowing larger payloads to be transported, but also more difficult as you have to take into account the tunneling overhead and each peers PMTU, which varies between providers. The underlying reasons are mostly PPPoE, Tunneling and IPv6 transition technologies like DS-Lite."

msgid "Determining the maximum MTU can be a tedious process, especially since the PMTU of peers could change at any time. The general recommendation for maximized compatibility is therefore the minimum MTU of 1312 Byte, which works well with all combinations of IPv4, IPv6, batman-adv compat v14 and v15."
